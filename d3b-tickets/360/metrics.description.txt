MIN_INSERT_SIZE	The minimum measured insert size. This is usually 1 and not very useful as it is likely artifactual.
MAX_INSERT_SIZE	The maximum measure insert size by alignment. This is usually very high representing either an artifact or possibly the presence of a structural re-arrangement.
MEAN_INSERT_SIZE	The mean insert size of the "core" of the distribution. Artefactual outliers in the distribution often cause calculation of nonsensical mean and stdev values. To avoid this the distribution is first trimmed to a "core" distribution of +/- N median absolute deviations around the median insert size. By default N=10, but this is configurable.
